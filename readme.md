# FunnelCake

> The idea behind FunnelCake is to have various modules connected to input sources (Twitter/FB/RSS) that will create draggable items on the left side of the screen, and output modules on the right side that will allow you to push that formatted data out to their endpoints. (Get it? We're funneling data... Metaphor, bro)  Initially designed to push small user-inputted messages ("shouts") to a TriCaster through Datalink, the scope is expanding. Maybe.
